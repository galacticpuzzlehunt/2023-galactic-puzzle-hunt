    <td>1: First I need to pick up my daughter from her cheer class at Birons Youth Sports Center. I get out of the parking lot and turn right onto the frontage road. I change lanes to the left four times to take the on-ramp onto I-10. But I&rsquo;ll need to take the Bunker Hill Rd exit soon, so I stay in the rightmost lane. (*)</td>
    <td rowspan="5"><img src='/static/puzzle_resources/gessner_mom.png' alt="An overhead view of some roads. At the top of the image, there's a narrow strip of grass, with a concrete middle portion. Below that is a 3-lane road with orange arrows in each lane, pointing left. Then there is an area with a tree, a grass lawn, and some bushes. After that is a 6-lane road, with orange arrows in each lane, pointing left. The road has shoulders on its left and right with no arrows. The dividing line between the shoulder and the topmost lane is solid white. The divind line between the first lane of the road and the second lane is a white dotted line. The divider between the bottommost lane and the shoulder is a solid yellow line. The dividers between the other lanes are white dashed lines. The second lane from the top has the text WEST and an interstate highway symbol with the number 10. Below the bottom shoulder of the 6-lane road is a concrete divider. Immediately below that is a shoulder, above 2-lane road pointing left. The 2-lane road has orange arrows in each lane, pointing left. The dividing line between the shoulder and the top lane is solid white. The dividing line between the two lanes is dashed white. The bottom line of the 2-lane road is solid yellow. Then there is a thick black line. Then there is a 2-lane road, with orange arrows in each lane, pointing right. The top line of this road is solid yellow. The divding line between the two lanes is dashed white. Below the 2 lanes is a solid white line, and a shoulder. Then there is a concrete divider, and a 6-lane road with orange arrows, pointing right. The 6-lane road has shoulders on either side. The dividing line between the top shoulder and the topmost lane is solid yellow. The dividing line between the 5th and 6th lanes is dotted white. The dividing line between the 6th lane and the bottom shoulder is solid white. The other dividing lines are dashed white. The 6th lane has an arrow in it depicting a right turn (i.e. the arrow starts out pointing to the right, then curves so it is pointing downward). Below the bottom shoulder of the 6-lane road is a thick horizontal black line. Then, there is a brown patch that initially runs parallel to the other lanes, but on the right, the bottom part curves up until it touches the top (which continues straight). Then, there is a 7-lane road, where each lane has an orange arrow pointing right. The 1st lane has an arrow depicting a U-turn (i.e. the arrow starts pointing right, then it curves up, then it curves left). It then contains the text ONLY, and another U-turn arrow. The 2nd lane has an arrow depicting a left turn (i.e. it starts pointing right, then curves up), then the text ONLY. The 3rd lane has an arrow depicting a left turn, then the text ONLY. The 4th lane has two arrows, one depicting going forward (i.e. it points right) and another branching off of it that depicts turning left. The 6th lane has two arrows, one depicting going forward (i.e. it points right) and another branching off of it that depicts turning right. The 7th lane has an arrow depicting turning right (i.e. it points right, then curves down) and the text ONLY."></td>
    <td>2: I need to grab donuts for a party later today, so I need to go to Shipley. To do this, I take the off-ramp to Bunker Hill Rd, passing underneath an on-ramp. Once I'm on the frontage road, I change lanes to the right to turn right after I see a Ciro&rsquo;s. I then drive through the parking lot to pick up my sweets. I then leave the parking lot, turning right on Bunker Hill Rd, and turn right onto Barryknoll Ln.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3: I then turn right on Frostwood Dr, left on Kingsride Ln, and right on Benignus Rd, and turn right once again onto the frontage road. I change lanes to the left four times again to take the on-ramp onto I-10. But this time, as soon as I merge onto the highway, I change lanes another four times to drive on the second-to-left lane. (*)</td>
    <td>4: I need to grab some tortillas from H-E-B so I realize I actually need to take the Bunker Hill Rd exit again, so I switch four lanes to the right, take the exit ramp onto the frontage road, turn left on Bunker Hill Rd, and turn left again after passing underneath the highway into the H-E-B parking lot. Once I pick up my stuff, I leave the parking lot turning right back onto Bunker Hill Rd, and turn right onto the frontage road. I immediately switch lanes twice to the left, to the leftmost lane that will not take me onto the on-ramp. (*)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5: I need to grab lunch for my son at Torchy&rsquo;s, so I switch two lanes to the right and turn right onto a driveway behind a parking garage towards Mathewson Ln. I cross Mathewson Ln into the Torchy&rsquo;s parking lot, with Memorial District Park on my left. Once I grab my food, I turn left onto Mathewson Ln out of the parking lot, and go straight at the Gessner Rd light, into another parking lot.</td>
    <td>6: I realize I don&rsquo;t want to get a car wash, so I make a U-turn and turn left onto Gessner Road. I turn right onto the frontage road, and immediately switch lanes to the left two times. (*)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7: I need to pick up some kimchi from Doosan, so I turn right onto Conrad Sauer Dr and turn right into the parking lot. After grabbing what I need, I turn right out of the parking lot onto Westview Dr.</td>
    <td>8: I need to grab a new lightbulb from Home Depot. I turn right onto Bunker Hill Rd and turn right onto the frontage road. I then immediately change lanes all the way to the left to take the on-ramp onto I-10. Once I merge, I switch lanes once to the left because I&rsquo;m going to exit soon, but not onto the Sam Houston Tollway. (*)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>9: I keep left at the split and then take the off-ramp and, after merging with the frontage road, turn right into the parking lot for Home Depot. I grab what I need and turn left out of the parking lot onto Lumpkin Road. I need to make one last stop today to return some clothes at Marshalls. I turn right onto the frontage road and immediately change lanes all the way to the left, and take the Texas U-turn to the eastbound frontage road. I take the on-ramp onto I-10 and change one lane to the left. (*)</td>
    <td>10: After changing lanes to the right again, I take the exit to the frontage road and turn right into the Marshalls parking lot, where I will complete my final errand for the day. </td>
