    </h2>

    
    <p>As mentioned in the preparation screen and cutscene text, this puzzle allows (and requires) the use of all of the legendary cards. </p>
<p>After experimenting with some combinations of the legendary cards, we will find that there are some extremely powerful combos involving two legendary cards. Furthermore, from reading the <span class="embed">Kero Dos</span> text, we can determine that there are six “waves” of enemies in total. This makes it natural to try to come up with six two-card combos to use the 12 legendary cards in.</p>
<p>There are some additional clues that can help narrow down where each card needs to be used: Slime and Moonick enable us to draw through most of the deck, which is most useful early on, and Mister Penny destroys our own bases, which would suggest it should be used last. </p>
<p>In addition to the legendary cards, across the battle, six small Creatures are needed in order to get enough Food to play the legendaries. Thus, an example 30-card deck could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>13 <span class="embed">Slime, Duplication Glitch</span></li>
<li>1 of each other legendary (11 total)</li>
<li>2 <span class="embed">Flora the Explora</span></li>
<li>2 <span class="embed">re</span></li>
<li>2 <span class="embed">Log</span></li>
</ul>
<p>With a deck like this, no special abilities of the non-legendary cards are needed, and there is some leeway for slightly sub-optimal play routes.</p>
<h4><span class="embed">Dinosaur Tail</span></h4>
<p>Legendaries used: 13 <span class="embed">Slime, Duplication Glitch</span>s and <span class="embed">Moonick</span>
Non-legendaries used: 1 <span class="embed">re</span></p>
<p><span class="embed">Dinosaur Tail</span>’s passive suggests summoning many Creatures will be useful in order to deal enough damage. After playing any small Creature (eg. <span class="embed">re</span>) on turn one, playing <span class="embed">Moonick</span>, followed by <span class="embed">Slime, Duplication Glitch</span>, will (very likely) fill the board with <span class="embed">Slime, Duplication Glitch</span>s and draw almost the entire deck. This gives two turns to attack with a full board, which will deal enough damage to defeat <span class="embed">Dinosaur Tail</span> (with some Food left over to finish drawing the deck).</p>
<p>In order to gain more consistency in this phase, it’s helpful (although not necessary) to use the Cardinal Director mastery to ensure <span class="embed">Moonick</span> is in the starting hand. Note that the same general strategy will work with fewer than 13 <span class="embed">Slime, Duplication Glitch</span>s, but the probability of the combo whiffing and not filling the board with enough Slimes increases dramatically as the number of Slimes in the deck decreases.</p>
<h4><span class="embed">Boar Tusks</span></h4>
<p>Legendaries used: <span class="embed">Coloring</span> and <span class="embed">Othello</span></p>
<p>This stage only gives us two turns, which suggests that using a card that can enable attacks on the turn it’s summoned, namely <span class="embed">Coloring</span>. In fact, <span class="embed">Coloring</span> and <span class="embed">Othello</span> can be used together to summon arbitrarily many copies of <span class="embed">Coloring</span>, by using the Flex of each newly summoned <span class="embed">Coloring</span> on <span class="embed">Othello</span>, and then copying another <span class="embed">Coloring</span>. These copies of <span class="embed">Coloring</span> can then attack immediately at no cost.</p>
<p>On the first turn, we need to summon three small Creatures (eg. 2 <span class="embed">Flora the Explora</span>, 1 <span class="embed">re</span>) to generate either Whipped Creams or Flowers, so that <span class="embed">Coloring</span> and <span class="embed">Othello</span> can be summoned together on turn two.</p>
<h4><span class="embed">Dryad Horns</span></h4>
<p>Legendaries used: <span class="embed">Jabberwock</span> and <span class="embed">Dargle</span></p>
<p><span class="embed">Dargle</span>'s text says "When this Creature deals Damage, it deals that amount of Damage to itself, and increases its Power by the same amount. <span class="embed">Jabberwock</span> reduces one instance of Damage to 0, since the smybol § gives the absolute difference between the next two values, and the next two symbols are the same.</p>
<p><span class="embed">Dryad Horns</span> have a huge amount of Health, suggesting exponential growth will be useful. On turn one, summon <span class="embed">Dargle</span>. On turn two, Summon <span class="embed">Jabberwock</span> and attack with <span class="embed">Dargle</span>, then use <span class="embed">Jabberwock</span>'s Special on <span class="embed">Dargle</span> and Attack with <span class="embed">Dargle</span> until <span class="embed">Dryad Horns</span> is defeated.</p>
<h4><span class="embed">Cow Leg</span>s and <span class="embed">Cow Udder</span></h4>
<p>Legendaries used: <span class="embed">Miss Yu</span> and <span class="embed">bb b</span></p>
<p>The full board of enemies suggests a card that can attack multiple times such as <span class="embed">Miss Yu</span> will be useful. By using <span class="embed">Miss Yu</span> in combination with <span class="embed">bb b</span>, <span class="embed">Miss Yu</span> can sweep through the entire board of <span class="embed">Cow Leg</span>s in one turn, and then defeat <span class="embed">Cow Udder</span>.</p>
<h4><span class="embed">Bee Wings</span></h4>
<p>Legendaries used: <span class="embed">Blancmange</span> and <span class="embed">Spelling Bee</span></p>
<p><span class="embed">Bee Wings</span> are immune to most methods of dealing damage, but a “donated” <span class="embed">Spelling Bee</span> can eliminate it. One additional small Creature (eg. <span class="embed">Log</span>) is needed to help generate enough Food to play <span class="embed">Blancmange</span> on turn two.</p>
<h4><span class="embed">Kero</span></h4>
<p>Legendaries used: <span class="embed">Captain Pi</span> and <span class="embed">Mister Penny</span></p>
<p><span class="embed">Kero</span>’s ability requires us to do a very large amount of damage at once, which <span class="embed">Captain Pi</span> can help with. </p>
<p>After playing any small Creature on turn one (eg. <span class="embed">Log</span>), we can summon <span class="embed">Mister Penny</span> on turn two, and <span class="embed">Captain Pi</span> on turn three by using <span class="embed">Mister Penny</span>’s Flex. <span class="embed">Captain Pi</span> can then simply attack twice for the win.</p>
<h3>Alternate Strategy</h3>
<p><img src="kero/alternate_strategy.png"/></p>
<p><span class="embed">Boar Tusks</span> can be defeated by an alternate strategy, using <span class="embed">Mister Penny</span> to ramp out <span class="embed">Queen of Bison</span> and <span class="embed">Coloring</span> on turn two to enable <span class="embed">Queen of Bison</span> to attack immediately. Teams that do this will naturally attempt to finish the battle from this state.</p>
<p>After progressing through the other phases as in the above solution, we then have access to <span class="embed">Captain Pi</span> and <span class="embed">Othello</span> to defeat <span class="embed">Kero</span>. <span class="embed">Othello</span> can be used to enable <span class="embed">Captain Pi</span> to attack twice on the turn after it is summoned, so we need some way to summon <span class="embed">Captain Pi</span> on turn four. By packing our deck with highly efficient ways to generate Food, this can barely be done, but requires using the minimum number of <span class="embed">Slime, Duplication Glitch</span> (so that more efficient Food generating Creatures can be added to the deck), and more specific plays during the other segments.</p>
<p>An example deck for this strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>8 <span class="embed">Slime, Duplication Glitch</span></li>
<li>1 of each other legendary (11 total)</li>
<li>2 <span class="embed">Chicken</span></li>
<li>2 <span class="embed">Glass of Moo</span></li>
<li>1 <span class="embed">Glass of Moocha</span></li>
<li>2 <span class="embed">Hamlet</span></li>
<li>2 <span class="embed">Hog</span></li>
<li>1 <span class="embed">Hog Hog</span></li>
<li>1 <span class="embed">Queen of Bison</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This strategy has significant overlap with the "standard" approach, but does require more specific conditions to be met at various points, so an example full fight plan is below:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="embed">Dinosaur Tail</span><ul>
<li>Use Cardinal Director to ensure <span class="embed">Moonick</span> is in the starting hand.</li>
<li>Restart until exactly one <span class="embed">Slime, Duplication Glitch</span> is in hand, as well as a <span class="embed">Hamlet</span> or <span class="embed">Hog</span>.</li>
<li>Turn 1: Play <span class="embed">Hamlet</span> or <span class="embed">Hog</span>.</li>
<li>Turn 2: Play <span class="embed">Moonick</span>.</li>
<li>Turn 3: Play <span class="embed">Slime, Duplication Glitch</span>.</li>
<li>Repeat the above steps until all eight <span class="embed">Slime, Duplication Glitch</span> are summoned onto the board. Making use of all three Instancers as well as the main puzzle can speed this part up.</li>
<li>Turn 4, 5: Attack with all Creatures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="embed">Boar Tusks</span><ul>
<li>Note that due to having fewer <span class="embed">Slime</span>s, this setup does not draw the full deck, so occasionally a reset will be needed here (or at the start of the next wave), if the required cards are not in hand.</li>
<li>Turn 1: Play <span class="embed">Hog</span> in the middle column. Play <span class="embed">Hamlet</span> anywhere. Play <span class="embed">Hamlet</span> or <span class="embed">Hog</span> anywhere (whichever one wasn't played on Turn 1 during <span class="embed">Dinosaur Tail</span>.</li>
<li>Turn 2: Create using <span class="embed">Hamlet</span> and the last Creature played during Turn 1. Play <span class="embed">Mister Penny</span> with 1 Food left over. Use <span class="embed">Mister Penny</span>'s Flex 9 times (3 on each Base) to generate 9 Food. Play <span class="embed">Queen of Bison</span> and <span class="embed">Coloring</span> (uses 8 Food, leaving 2 Food left over). Use <span class="embed">Coloring</span>'s Flex on <span class="embed">Queen of Bison</span>. Attack with <span class="embed">Queen of Bison</span> and the <span class="embed">Hog</span> in the middle column.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="embed">Dryad Horns</span><ul>
<li>Turn 1: Play <span class="embed">Dargle</span>.</li>
<li>Turn 2: Attack with <span class="embed">Dargle</span> and play <span class="embed">Jabberwock</span>.</li>
<li>Turn 3+: Use <span class="embed">Jabberwock</span>'s Special on <span class="embed">Dargle</span> and attack with <span class="embed">Dargle</span>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="embed">Cow Leg</span>s and <span class="embed">Cow Udder</span><ul>
<li>Turn 1: Play <span class="embed">Miss Yu</span>.</li>
<li>Turn 2: Play <span class="embed">bb b</span> next to <span class="embed">Miss Yu</span>. Attack all of the <span class="embed">Cow Leg</span>s with <span class="embed">Miss Yu</span>, then attack <span class="embed">Cow Udder</span>.</li>
<li>Turn 3: Attack <span class="embed">Cow Udder</span> with <span class="embed">Miss Yu</span>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="embed">Bee Wings</span><ul>
<li>Turn 1: Play <span class="embed">Hog Hog</span> in R4C2. Play <span class="embed">Spelling Bee</span> in R4C3.</li>
<li>Turn 2: Play <span class="embed">Blancmange</span>. Use <span class="embed">Blancmange</span>'s Flex on <span class="embed">Spelling Bee</span>, moving it to R3C3. <span class="embed">Spelling Bee</span>'s damage will destroy both <span class="embed">Bee Wings</span> and <span class="embed">Hog Hog</span>, giving a <span class="embed">Hog</span> in hand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="embed">Kero</span><ul>
<li>Turn 1: Play 2 <span class="embed">Chicken</span> and 1 <span class="embed">Hog</span> (generated from the <span class="embed">Hog Hog</span> in the previous phase).</li>
<li>Turn 2: Create with <span class="embed">Hog</span>. Play <span class="embed">Othello</span>. Use 2 <span class="embed">Chicken</span> Specials.</li>
<li>Turn 3: Use 2 <span class="embed">Chicken</span> Specials. Create with <span class="embed">Hog</span>. Play 2 <span class="embed">Glass of Moo</span> and 1 <span class="embed">Glass of Moocha</span></li>
<li>Turn 4: Create with 2 <span class="embed">Chicken</span>, 1 <span class="embed">Hog</span>, 1 <span class="embed">Othello</span>. Use 2 <span class="embed">Glass of Moo</span> Special and 1 <span class="embed">Glass of Moocha</span> Special. Play <span class="embed">Captain Pi</span>.</li>
<li>Turn 5: Use <span class="embed">Othello</span>'s Special on <span class="embed">Captain Pi</span>. Attack with both <span class="embed">Captain Pi</span> and the copied <span class="embed">Captain Pi</span>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This strategy can also work with some slight modifications, but requires similar tricks like using <span class="embed">Glass of Moo</span> and <span class="embed">Chicken</span> to generate extra Food, and sacrificing <span class="embed">Hog Hog</span> after using it to generate Food in order to achieve more card efficiency.</p>
<p>In fact, it's possible to generate so much Food that it is possible to attack 3 times with <span class="embed">Captain Pi</span>, which is a fun challenge. </p>
<details><summary>See solution:</summary><ul><li>Bring an additional <span class="embed">Hog Hog</span>, replacing a <span class="embed">Hog</span>, and use the <span class="embed">Hog Hog</span> instead of the <span class="embed">Hog</span> against <span class="embed">Boar Tusks</span>.

    <h2 id="authors-notes">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
    <p>Early on in the hunt writing process, there were various discussions about what to do as a “capstone” puzzle for this hunt, since a traditional meta wouldn’t be possible (since the card battles don’t have answers). I came up with this “final battle” requiring cards obtained over the course of the hunt as an alternative. I thought that allowing players to execute really "broken" combos would feel like an epic conclusion to the hunt.</p>
<p>Since some of the combos would trivialize other puzzles, I added the restriction that players can only use one legendary card in their deck outside of this final battle.</p>
<p>An earlier version of this puzzle had a version of <span class="embed">Boar Tusks</span> with much more Health, since the combo intended to be used for that part can deal arbitrary amounts of damage. However, I lowered its Health so that players wouldn't have to press as many buttons to repeatedly execute the combo. This enabled the alternative solution with <span class="embed">Mister Penny</span>, <span class="embed">Coloring</span>, and <span class="embed">Queen of Bison</span>. I decided to keep this in, because in testing it enabled teams to see through to the end of the puzzle, at which point they saw the <span class="embed">Captain Pi</span> + <span class="embed">Mister Penny</span> combo for <span class="embed">Kero</span>, and then deduced that they should use <span class="embed">Coloring</span> and <span class="embed">Othello</span> instead for <span class="embed">Boar Tusks</span>. </p>
<p>I was a little surprised that some teams pushed through and made the Alternate Strategy above work, but it seemed that teams that opted for this approach really enjoyed executing the Alternate Strategy, so I'm glad it was available to them.</p>
<p>Fans of Magic: The Gathering might notice that some of the card combinations and effects are quite similar to some well known MTG combos. In particular, the <span class="embed">Coloring</span> + <span class="embed">Othello</span> combination is similar to the <span class="embed" data-embed-type="mtg">Splinter Twin</span> combo (with <span class="embed" data-embed-type="mtg">Pestermite</span>, or a similar card), and the <span class="embed">Slime, Duplication Glitch</span> + <span class="embed">Moonick</span> combination was inspired by MTG’s “ripple” mechanic. An earlier concept for <span class="embed">Blancmange</span> was similar to <span class="embed" data-embed-type="mtg">Phyrexian Dreadnought</span>.</p>
<p>Lastly, I really want to thank DD for her work on the animations and art for this puzzle, which really brought it to life.</p>
