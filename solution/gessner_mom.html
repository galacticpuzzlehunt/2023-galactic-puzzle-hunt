    </h2>

    
    <p>This is a puzzle about a mom driving to run various errands around Houston, Texas. </p>
<p>The screenshot depicts a section of Interstate 10 just west of its exit at Gessner Road. In this section, including the
central managed lanes and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontage_road">frontage roads</a>, the freeway includes 26 total
lanes. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three westbound frontage road lanes</li>
<li>Six westbound freeway lanes</li>
<li>Two westbound managed lanes</li>
<li>Two eastbound managed lanes</li>
<li>Six eastbound freeway lanes</li>
<li>Seven eastbound frontage road lanes, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_U-turn">Texas U-turn</a> on the far left</li>
</ul>
<p>Because there are 26 lanes, we can assign a letter of the alphabet to each one, starting with A as the northernmost, westbound frontage road lane and Z as the
southernmost, eastbound right turn lane on the frontage road. Solving this puzzle requires tracing the path in the
description by the mom as she makes her journey, and tracing which lane she is in when she crosses through the screenshotted
area, noted with a (*) symbol. For example, if the first time the mom crosses through the screenshotted area, she uses the
third lane from the top, namely the leftmost westbound frontage road lane, then the letter extracted from that crossing is C.</p>
<p>Below are descriptions of the key instructions to determine the lane number:</p>
<ol>
<li>Before crossing through the area for the first time (*), the mom says <strong>&ldquo;I stay in the rightmost lane&rdquo;</strong>. She
is on the eastbound freeway, because she has just taken the on-ramp. This is the 19th lane from the top or <strong>S</strong>.</li>
<li>After driving all the way around to get back to about where she started, the mom takes the same on-ramp again, but this
time, changes four lanes to <strong>&ldquo;drive on the second-to-left lane&rdquo;</strong>. This is the 15th lane from the top or <strong>O</strong>.</li>
<li>After turning right onto the westbound frontage road from Bunker Hill Road, she says that she will <strong>&ldquo;switch lanes
twice to the left, to the leftmost lane that will not take me onto the on-ramp&rdquo;</strong>. This spot is a bit far from the
screenshotted area, but following the lane westward shows that at the screenshotted area, it remains the third from top lane,
or <strong>C</strong>.</li>
<li>After turning right onto the westbound frontage road again from Gessner Road, she says that she will <strong>&ldquo;immediately
switch lanes to the left two times.&rdquo;</strong> This is the third lane from the top again, or <strong>C</strong>.</li>
<li>At the next point, she is on the westbound freeway lanes. She says that she will <strong>&ldquo;switch lanes once to the left&rdquo;</strong>
because she is intending to exit back onto the frontage road, not onto the Sam Houston Tollway. This is the fifth lane from
the top, or <strong>E</strong>. Note that while this lane could exit onto the Sam Houston Tollway, the lane splits farther west.</li>
<li>Following taking the Texas U-turn, she is back onto the eastbound frontage road, and takes the same on-ramp as the first
time, and is back onto the eastbound freeway. She says that she will <strong>&ldquo;change one lane to the left&rdquo;</strong>, which is
the second lane from the right on the eastbound freeway. This is the 18th lane from the top, or <strong>R</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>These six crossings spell out <span class="spoiler">SOCCER</span>, the correct answer, as she is, of course, a soccer mom.</p>

    
    
    <h2 id="authors-notes">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
    <p>This puzzle is, on the surface, about a very silly coincidence about the number 26. But the fact that this One More Lane Bro meme incarnate has 26 lanes is not merely a numerical curiosity but rather a result of some truly cursed urban planning policy decisions. </p>
<p>I wanted this puzzle to reflect several aspects of the suburban Texas condition:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The confusingness of Texas driving</strong>. When I first moved to Texas, I could not fathom the Google Maps instructions directing me to merge on and off frontage roads and use special U-turn lanes. It would ask me to execute ridiculous maneuvers merging across many lanes just to access a specific parking lot. I found these instructions extremely difficult to execute live, so I wanted everyone else to feel this confusion, too.</li>
<li><strong>The unpleasantness of suburban public spaces</strong>. I think that being in the vicinity of a tremendous freeway like this, whether on foot, on a bike, or in a car, all of which I've now done, is a stressful, disgusting, and dangerous experience. Furthermore, I wanted to showcase the enormity of Texas parking lots, as they say that everything is bigger in Texas, and they are right. I wanted solvers to see the tragedy of this public setting as they scroll around this part of Houston.</li>
<li><strong>The inconvenience of suburban errand-running</strong>. In this puzzle, I wanted to capture the difficulty of running a relatively mundane set of errands. The mom needs to pick up her kid, grab some groceries, buy some clothes; the quotidian logistical experiences of life. But instead, she needs to circle several times, following confusing routing and guzzling gasoline. Obviously, her routing is exaggerated for the puzzle purposes, but I wanted solvers to feel the arduousness of running errands in a small set of nearby establishments when so much asphalt is in the way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Texas is home to diverse, thriving, and cosmopolitan cities like Houston. In many ways, it takes aspects of the great American suburbanization experiment and exaggerates them to silly extremes. While I know this brings pride to many Texans, I wrote this puzzle to share my personal distaste for these aspects, and perhaps, just a little bit, my wishes for designing better places.</p>
