    <p>This battle is a game of Othello, modified to fit this card game. After each player&rsquo;s turn, their pieces attack in
front of them in their column, damaging and potentially destroying enemy pieces. If there is no piece to attack, then the
opposing Player is dealt 1 damage instead. Another difference in the rules is that we may play a piece touching any other
piece&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t have to flip any pieces over.</p>
<p>As the computer player starts with the first turn and a large health lead, we have to overcome a large deficit to win this
battle. The computer player has some weaknesses in its play that can be exploited: it doesn&rsquo;t look ahead at any turns,
and doesn&rsquo;t account for the battle portion of the game rules. It also plays deterministically, so we can
reliably get to certain positions and look for moves where the situation turns out favorably for us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to describe how best to play, but here are some pointers:</p>
<ul>
<li>As in regular Othello, edges and especially corners are harder to take back by capturing, and tend to be stronger places to
play. In particular, the corners are very desirable, as are the squares on the edges that are two away from the corners (as
the other player trying to surround them opens us up to respond by playing in the corner).</li>
<li>The battle portion of the rules adds an asymmetry to the board&mdash;for example, if we have a corner piece on the top row,
it can never be retaken by the opponent, but if we have a corner piece on the bottom row, the opponent can destroy it with
battling.</li>
<li>Because of the way the health numbers are tuned, we are in a bit of a race to stabilize the rate at which we 
take damage before we lose all our health. Once we start getting an advantage in the number of pieces, we&rsquo;re
incentivized to have our units fight each other rather than attack past each other.</li>
<li>Be on the lookout for tactical plays introduced by units destroying each other&mdash;sometimes we can make a capture that
would normally be immediately recapturable, but an enemy piece that would enable that loses all its remaining Health on the
same turn!</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example solving video.</p>

    <h2 id="authors-notes">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h2>
    <p>This was the first card battle that I finished writing. It was written pretty early on in the process,
I think before we as a team had a good grip on what our card game looked like (or at the very least,
before I felt I had a grip on it). Due to the nature of this puzzle, I didn't need to understand
the card game particularly well to make it, and solvers didn't need to know it particularly well to solve this!</p>
<p>The earliest version had a lot more even starting health totals, but early testers beat it before
even really thinking through the game, so I ended up tuning that for difficulty. I also added a basic
heuristic where the AI prefers playing in corners and avoids exposing the corners. Otherwise, the AI
is not particularly smart, though it starts off with enough of an advantage that it can seem pretty scary at first.</p>
<p>I also experimented with units having 2 Health or 4 Health instead of the 3 they have now. At 4, the
attacking mechanic didn't feel relevant at all, and at 2, it seemed like pure chaos and also hard to deal
with the AI's initial advantage.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Alan for the card art for this battle and Jenna for drawing Othello!</p>
