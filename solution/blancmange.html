    <p>In this puzzle battle, the following rule modifications are in effect:</p>
<ul><li>All cards whose names start with a K, N, P, Q, R, or B are modified by
    this puzzle. We will refer to these cards as <emph>pieces</emph>.</li><li>Pieces come into play with a +1 Power buff to hint that they are
    special.</li><li>Pieces use the attack rules of the chess piece signified by their first
    letter. They ignore the card game’s "protection" mechanic, but can be
    blocked by friendly or enemy units along their attack path. When a piece
    attacks and destroys a unit, it automatically moves to the space the
    destroyed unit occupied.</li><ul><li><span class="embed">Boarry Farmer</span>’s column-only attack restriction is
      silently replaced its diagonal-only attack restriction.</li></ul><li>Piece <emph>movement</emph> is unaffected; they still only move one space
    orthogonally.</li><li>P-pieces are automatically replaced by
    <span class="embed">Quail Aboard Fiery Steeds</span> when they enter the opposing
    player’s back row.</li></ul>

<p>In order to solve the puzzle, when the opponent’s <strike>Camp</strike>
<span class="embed">Keep</span> is destroyed, its space and all touching spaces must
either be under attack by pieces, or blocked by the opponent’s own Units.</p>
<p>Like most puzzles, the opponent disregards any sense of economic fairness, and
instead automatically summons Units just to make life difficult:</p>
<ul><li>Before the player’s first turn, the opponent spawns a line of
    <span class="embed">Petroleum Jelly</span>s in the row in front of its
    <span class="embed">Keep</span>.</li><li>Before the player’s third turn, the opponent spawns three
    <span class="embed">Vanilla Calf</span>s in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th cells in the row in
    front of its <span class="embed">Keep</span>.</li><li>Before the player’s fifth turn, the opponent spawns two
    <span class="embed">Bell Flower</span>s in the back corners of the board, and two more in
    the two spaces in front of them.</li><li>Before the player’s seventh turn, the opponent spawns a line of
    <span class="embed">Petroleum Jelly</span>s in the row in front of its
    <span class="embed">Keep</span>.</li><li>Before the player’s eighth turn, the opponent spawns two
    <span class="embed">Realistic Rex</span>es in the back row of the board, priortizing the corners.</li><li>Before the player’s tenth turn, and every three player turns thereafter,
    the opponent spawns two <span class="embed">Realistic Rex</span>es, two
    <span class="embed">Bell Flower</span>s, and a
    <span class="embed">Quail Aboard Fiery Steeds</span> in its back row. 
    (The last spawn doesn't usually happen due to the <span class="embed">Keep</span> occupying the spot.)</li></ul>

<p>Note that opponent spawns can usually be blocked by having a unit in the place where it
wants to spawn, so "capturing" a piece on one of its two back rows not only
removes the existing piece but also can prevent a reinforcement from appearing.</p>
<p>Opponent pieces attack if able, and otherwise move in a way that best pressures
the player Keep. Note that opponent <span class="embed">Petroleum Jelly</span>s do
promote into <span class="embed">Quail Aboard Fiery Steeds</span> if they’re allowed to
reach the player back rank.</p>
<p>The main challenge in this battle is getting enough Units into play to contest
the tide of free units the opponent produces. There are a few ways to do this,
but here is a Yellow/Green/Purple deck that can win without using Legendaries,
along with hints on how to use them:</p>
<ul><li><span class="embed">Bee Rider</span></li><ul><li>A Bishop that gets to adjust its position for free each turn.</li></ul><li><span class="embed">Beethoven</span></li><ul><li>Good for tanking hits while we get everything else set up.</li></ul><li><span class="embed">Bell Flower</span></li><ul><li>A Bishop that can one-hit everything except Rooks.</li></ul><li><span class="embed">Chicken</span></li><ul><li>Food economy; keep it in the back ranks and use it for Pie whenever
    it doesn’t have anything better to do.</li></ul><li><span class="embed">Dino Nugget</span></li><ul><li>Just a 1-cost card that sometimes makes our other chaff harder to
    kill while we get set up.</li></ul><li><span class="embed">Eager Beever</span></li><ul><li>An easy source of Honey for our other Yellow cards. Use it to
    body-block the opponent’s Pawns, or in late game to cheat one of our own
    Pawns across the board.</li></ul><li><span class="embed">Flora the Explora</span></li><ul><li>Card draw, 1-cost Flower source.</li></ul><li><span class="embed">Nam & Pam Bee</span></li><ul><li>A Knight that can one-hit everything except Rooks.</li></ul><li><span class="embed">Nightshade</span></li><ul><li>This Unit’s Special is not an attack and is not restricted by the
    chess gimmick. Good for converting unwanted cards into damage.</li></ul><li><span class="embed">PBee & J</span></li><ul><li>Cheap source of Honey; also okay for blocking or trading against the
    opponent’s Pawns while we get set up.</li></ul><li><span class="embed">Petroleum Jelly</span></li><ul><li>Cheap source of Eggs; also good for getting through the initial Pawn
    wave and menacing the <span class="embed">Vanilla Calf</span>s behind it.</li></ul><li><span class="embed">Realistic Rex</span></li><ul><li>If we can get this out on our second turn, it’s an efficient way to
    clean up a lot of the opponent’s unit spam. Keep in mind, though, that when
    using its Special both its targets must be chosen from its initial position
    (rather than choosing the second target predicated on its successful
    "capture" of the first).</li></ul><li><span class="embed">Yoshisaur Munchakoopas</span></li><ul><li>Just here to shore up any targeting or tanking weaknesses.</li></ul></ul>

<p>Restart the battle until we draw a hand containing three 1-cost cards,
preferably including a <span class="embed">Chicken</span>.</p>
<p>On turn 1, play the <span class="embed">Chicken</span> to one of our back corners and the other two 1-cost
cards to your front corners.</p>
<p>On turn 2, if you have <span class="embed">Realistic Rex</span> in hand, first use one of our existing
Units to Create, and destroy a Pawn with another. Then Create with the third unit, and
summon <span class="embed">Realistic Rex</span> somewhere it won’t get attacked. Otherwise, use the front
units to knock out the Pawns threatening them, and use the <span class="embed">Chicken</span> to either get</p>
<p>a 2-cost unit onto the board or to generate more energy for next turn.</p>
<p>After this, the strategic points are:</p>
<ul><li>Eliminate threats to board development (i.e. remove as many enemy
    pieces as possible). Ideally, we get Bishops or Knights &ndash; all of
    which have 3 Power including the puzzle-specific Power buff &ndash; into
    positions where they can knock out <span class="embed">Vanilla Calf</span>s (turn 3) or <span class="embed">Bell Flower</span>s
    (turn 5) as soon as they spawn.</li><li>Ignore the opponent’s side <span class="embed">Petroleum Jelly</span>s. Block them with
    small Units, which will generally be used to Create food instead of
    attacking. As long as we don’t sit a unit on their one attackable square,
    they’re not a threat.</li><li>At the beginning, 1-cost summons are good for Creating food on a subsequent
    turn. The main exception is <span class="embed">Yoshisaur Munchakoopas</span>, who is not constrained by chess
    geometry the way the most of our other units will be.</li><li>The win condition is to place a Bishop, Pawn, or Knight in a place where
    it can deal a killing blow to the enemy Keep. <span class="embed">Beethoven</span> on
    the second row is especially good at staying alive a turn longer than usual
    due to its defensive ability. <strong>On our tenth turn, after the opponent
    fills its first two rows, use this unit to deliver a
    <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smothered_mate">smothered mate</a>,
    using its reinforcements against it.</strong></li></ul>

<p>If we have access to <span class="embed">bb b, brave as can b</span>, we can add it to
feed off all the early Pawns we’ll be destroying. In this case, we probably
won’t need to use any tricks and can win just by having more Power and units.
The hardest part will be getting our units in position to checkmate without
getting interrupted by reinforcements. Using <span class="embed">Eager Beever</span> to
teleport a Pawn or Rook onto the opponent’s back rank helps a lot.</p>
