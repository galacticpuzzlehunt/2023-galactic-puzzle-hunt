<p>This puzzle is presented as an Einstein-style logic puzzle. Each animal makes 3 statements, which we will use to determine 3 things about every animal:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Its position within a 3&times;3 grid of houses.</li>
  <li>The number of that type of animal there are within the house.</li>
  <li>The number of floors their house has.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Logic puzzle walkthrough</h2>

<strong>Eagle: My house has 5 floors and is tied with one other house for second tallest.</strong><br/>
<strong>Rabbit: My house has strictly more floors than any other.</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Chicken: The number of floors in my house is 4 times the number of residents.</strong><br/>
We know that the tallest house is the Rabbit house, and then 2 animal families (Eagle and one other) are tied for 2nd-tallest
with 5 floors. If there were 2 Chickens, the Chicken house would have 8 floors. So there must be 1 Chicken and 4 floors.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Squirrel: My family is twice as large as the spiders&rsquo;.</strong><br/>
<strong>My house is one of 3 that have the same number of floors as residents.</strong><br/>
From this, we can conclude that there are fewer than 3 Spiders. (If there were 3 Spiders, there would be 6 Squirrels, and 
then the Squirrel house would have 6 floors, but this also contradicts what we know about the Rabbit & Eagle house heights.)<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Spider: My family size is less than my number of floors, and is even.</strong><br/>
The only even number less than 3 (our current upper bound on the number of Spiders) is 2. Therefore, there are 2 Spiders.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Squirrel: My family is twice as large as the spiders&rsquo;.</strong><br/>
<strong>My house is one of 3 that have the same number of floors as residents.</strong><br/>
Since there are 2 Spiders, there must be 4 Squirrels, and the Squirrel house must be 4 floors.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Honeybee: My family is the same size as the squirrels&rsquo;</strong><br/>
There are 4 Honeybees.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Ant: The number of floors in my house is equal to the number of squirrels.</strong><br/>
<strong>The number of residents in my house is half the number of floors.</strong><br/>
The Ant house has 4 floors, and there are 2 Ants.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Honeybee: My house has the same number of floors as the ants&rsquo;.</strong><br/>
The Honeybees&rsquo; house has 4 floors.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Badger: My house has half the number of floors of the southwest house.</strong><br/>
<strong>My house has two fewer residents than floors.</strong><br/>
The minimum # of residents is 1. So the Badger house must have at least 3 floors. Therefore, the minimum # floors of the SW 
house is 6. So, the Rabbits must live in the southwest house.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Rabbit: My family has 6 members.</strong><br/>
<strong>Squirrel: I live in the southeast house.</strong><br/>
<strong>Honeybee: My family is strictly larger than the other families in my row and my column. </strong><br/>
We know that 6 Rabbits live in the southwest house, 4 Squirrels live in the southeast house, and there are 4 Honeybees. 
Therefore, the Honeybees cannot live in the west column, or the east column, or the south row.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Beaver: I live in the center house.</strong>
The central house is already taken, so the Honeybees must live in the north house in the middle column.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Chicken: The honeybees live in my column.</strong>
The Chicken must live in the south house in the middle column.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Badger: My two neighboring houses contain animals with strictly more legs than me.</strong><br/>
<strong>Eagle: Both of my neighbors&rsquo; houses have queens.</strong><br/>
The Badger and Eagle houses are in corners. We also already know that the Rabbits live in the southwest house and the 
Squirrels live in the southeast house. All corners are now &ldquo;accounted for&rdquo;.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Spider: All of my neighbors&rsquo; names either start with the same letter as mine or end with the same letter as mine.</strong>
The animal names with this property are BADGER, BEAVER, and SQUIRREL. We know that the Spiders cannot live in a corner, so 
they live on an &ldquo;edge&rdquo;, and have 3 neighbors. One of those neighbors will be the central house, belonging to 
Beaver(s). The other two, therefore, must be the Badger and Squirrel houses. We already know that the Squirrels live in the 
southeast, and that one of the spots adjacent to them is already occupied by Chicken. Therefore, the Spiders live in the 
east house in the middle row. Then, the northeast house must belong to Badger(s).<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Eagle: Both of my neighbors&rsquo; houses have queens.</strong><br/>
The Eagle house is in one of the corners. The only corner remaining is the northwest corner. This also determines the 
placement of the Ants, who must live in the west house in the middle row.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Ant: My northern neighbors have 1 more resident than I do.</strong><br/>
There are 2 Ants, so there are 3 Eagles.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Beaver: My family is the same size as the northwest house&rsquo;s.</strong><br/>
<strong>My house has the same number of floors as the northwest house.</strong><br/>
There are 3 Beavers in a house with 5 floors.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, our house layout looks like this:<br/>
<table class="table-with-borders">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Eagle</strong></div>
      <div>3 residents</div>
      <div>5 floors</div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Honeybee</strong></div>
      <div>4 residents</div>
      <div>4 floors</div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Badger</strong></div>
      <div>(# floors)&minus;2 residents</div>
      <div>≥ 3 floors</div>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Ant</strong></div>
      <div>2 residents</div>
      <div>4 floors</div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Beaver</strong></div>
      <div>3 residents</div>
      <div>5 floors</div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Spider</strong></div>
      <div>2 residents</div>
      <div>(# Badger floors) floors</div>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Rabbit</strong></div>
      <div>6 residents</div>
      <div>≥ 6 floors</div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Chicken</strong></div>
      <div>1 resident</div>
      <div>4 floors</div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Squirrel</strong></div>
      <div>4 residents</div>
      <div>4 floors</div>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table><br/>

<strong>Squirrel: My house is one of 3 that have the same number of floors as residents.</strong><br/>
Currently, the Honeybee and Squirrel have the same number of floors as residents. The Badger cannot have the same number of 
floors as residents. The Spider also can&rsquo;t, because (# Badger floors) ≥ 3. Therefore, the Rabbits must have 6 floors to
satisfy this constraint.<br/>
<strong>Badger: My house has half the number of floors of the southwest house.</strong><br/>
<strong>My house has two fewer residents than floors.</strong><br/>
The Badger house has 3 floors, and there is 1 Badger.<br/>
<strong>Spider: My house has the same number of floors as the house north of mine.</strong><br/>
The Spider house has 3 floors.

<h2 id="extraction">Extraction</h2>
Now here is the full solution to the logic puzzle:<br/>
<table class="table-with-borders">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Eagle</strong></div>
      <div>3 residents</div>
      <div>5 floors</div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Honeybee</strong></div>
      <div>4 residents</div>
      <div>4 floors</div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Badger</strong></div>
      <div>1 resident</div>
      <div>3 floors</div>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Ant</strong></div>
      <div>2 residents</div>
      <div>4 floors</div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Beaver</strong></div>
      <div>3 residents</div>
      <div>5 floors</div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Spider</strong></div>
      <div>2 residents</div>
      <div>3 floors</div>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Rabbit</strong></div>
      <div>6 residents</div>
      <div>6 floors</div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Chicken</strong></div>
      <div>1 resident</div>
      <div>4 floors</div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Squirrel</strong></div>
      <div>4 residents</div>
      <div>4 floors</div>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table><br/>

To extract, we might notice that the # of residents is always less than or equal to the # of floors. So perhaps # of residents
is indexing into # of floors.<br/>
<br/>
The key realization is that there are special names for the houses of each of these animals. In fact, the number of floors of
each animal&rsquo;s house is the enumeration of that special name. Now we can write them out and perform the indexing (indexed
letters are bracketed and highlighted):<br/>

<table class="table-with-borders">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Eagle (AE[<span class="extract">R</span>]IE/EY[<span class="extract">R</span>]IE)</strong></div>
      <div>3 residents</div>
      <div>5 floors</div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Honeybee (HIV[<span class="extract">E</span>])</strong></div>
      <div>4 residents</div>
      <div>4 floors</div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Badger ([<span class="extract">S</span>]ET)</strong></div>
      <div>1 resident</div>
      <div>3 floors</div>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Ant (H[<span class="extract">I</span>]LL)</strong></div>
      <div>2 residents</div>
      <div>4 floors</div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Beaver (LO[<span class="extract">D</span>]GE)</strong></div>
      <div>3 residents</div>
      <div>5 floors</div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Spider (W[<span class="extract">E</span>]B)</strong></div>
      <div>2 residents</div>
      <div>3 floors</div>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Rabbit (WARRE[<span class="extract">N</span>])</strong></div>
      <div>6 residents</div>
      <div>6 floors</div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Chicken ([<span class="extract">C</span>]OOP)</strong></div>
      <div>1 resident</div>
      <div>4 floors</div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div><strong>Squirrel (DRE[<span class="extract">Y</span>])</strong></div>
      <div>4 residents</div>
      <div>4 floors</div>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table><br/>

Now reading the extracted letters in reading order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom) yields the answer, <span class="spoiler">RESIDENCY</span>.
