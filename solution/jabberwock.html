    <p>In this battle, the enemy Gostaks deal damage to each of our Unprotected Units every turn according to some string of symbols,
whose meanings depend on various aspects of the Creature being damaged
and which we must determine.</p>
<p>Generally, the goal is to experiment with different Creatures until we understand the symbols&rsquo; meanings, then
&ldquo;stabilize&rdquo; by finding a configuration of Creatures so that our Unprotected Creatures take 0 damage each turn. From there 
we can either just attack with our Creature repeatedly until the Gostak is defeated, or find ways to optimize and play
stronger Protected Creatures.</p>
<h2>Gostaks I, II, III</h2>
<p>Gostak I introduces &ldquo;◆&rdquo;, Power of target, so we can stabilize by playing any 0-Power Creatures in front.</p>
<p>Gostak II introduces &ldquo;♠&rdquo;, Health of target (not Current Health, i.e. the number that&rsquo;s unaffected by Damage). You can stabilize by playing <span class="embed">Petroleum Jelly</span> in the middle column.
This Gostak&rsquo;s health is also low enough for us to survive with various other cards that reduce damage and deal enough damage before our Camps are destroyed.</p>
<p>Gostak III introduces &ldquo;§&rdquo;, the absolute difference of the next two symbols: here, they are ◆ Power and ♠ Health. It is pretty easy to stabilize since we can play any of the many Creatures with equal Power and Health.</p>
<p>All three fights can be defeated by bringing a deck with 1&times; <span class="embed">Petroleum Jelly</span>, playing it in R4C3, then repeatedly
attacking with it over the next 10 turns. To speed things up, we can add 1&times; <span class="embed">Yoshisaur Munchakoopas</span>, playing it in R5C3,
and then repeatedly attacking with it over the next 5 Turns.</p>
<h2>Gostak IV</h2>
<p>This battle introduces &ldquo;‡&rdquo;, length of target&rsquo;s name, as well as a Gostak with a higher Health to encourage more
optimization. To stabilize, we want a Creature with §◆‡ = 0, that is, a Creature whose Power equals the length of its name; <span class="embed">o</span> fits the bill.</p>
<p>The solution that&rsquo;s simplest to describe is to bring 1&times; <span class="embed">o</span>, playing it in R4C3, then repeatedly attacking with it over the next 25 turns.</p>
<p>As before, we can play a <span class="embed">Yoshisaur Munchakoopas</span> behind it to just do it in 1 + 13 turns.</p>
<p>For even more efficiency, bring 2&times; <span class="embed">o</span>, 1&times; <span class="embed">Glass of Moo</span> or <span class="embed">Glass of Moocha</span>, and 1&times; <span class="embed">Queen of Bison</span>. Then:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin"><li>Turn 1: Play o on R4C1 and R4C3.</li><li>Turn 2: Play Glass on R5C3.</li><li>Turn 3: Special with Glass and Create with both o&rsquo;s, then play Queen of Bison etc. on R5C3.</li><li>Turn 4, 5, 6: Attack with Queen of Bison.</li></ol>

<h2>Gostak V</h2>
<p>This battle introduces two new symbols at once: &ldquo;✠&rdquo;, the <a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/manhattanDistance.html">Manhattan distance</a>
between the Gostak and the Creature, and &ldquo;♫&rdquo;, A1Z26 of the first letter of the target&rsquo;s color. (These two can&rsquo;t be
disambiguated from each other yet, but the symbols are meant to be slightly semantically suggestive, and there&rsquo;s no need to disambiguate them until Gostak VII.)</p>
<p>Unlike the previous battles, there is no way to stabilize on the first turn, because there&rsquo;s no overlap between the Manhattan distances of Spaces where we can play a Creature (3 to 6) and the A1Z26 numbers of the first letters of colors in the game (2=B for Black, 7=G for Green/Gray, 16=P for Purple, 18=R for Red, and 25=Y for Yellow). However, it&rsquo;s very close on both ends. To stabilize, we
can protect a <span class="embed">Beeowulf</span> for a turn and move the Gostak one space to the left or right to allow us to play Green or Gray Creatures at a distance of 7, or move the Gostak one space down to allow us to play a Black Creature at a distance of 2. Also, even without moving the Gostak, Green/Gray Creatures at distance 6 and Black Creatures at distance 3 often can survive long enough for us to win anyway.</p>
<p>One solution: Bring 2&times; <span class="embed">Beeowulf</span>, 2&times; <span class="embed">Petroleum Jelly</span>, 1&times; <span class="embed">Yoshisaur Munchakoopas</span>. Then:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin"><li>Turn 1: Play Beeowulf R4C3, R5C3 and Petroleum Jelly R4C5.</li><li>Turn 2: Special with Beeowulf to move the Gostak left. Play Petroleum Jelly R5C5.</li><li>Turn 3: Play Yoshisaur Munchakoopas R6C4.</li><li>Turn 4 to 16: Attack with Yoshisaur Munchakoopas.</li></ol>

<p>A faster solution: Bring 1&times; <span class="embed">Nice Cow</span>, 1&times; <span class="embed">Beeowulf</span>. Then:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin"><li>Turn 1: Play Nice Cow R4C3, Beeowulf R5C3.</li><li>Turn 2: Special with Beeowulf to move Gostak down.</li><li>Turn 3, 4, 5, 6: Create with Beeowulf, then Special with Nice Cow.</li><li>Turn 7, 8, 9, 10: Attack with Beeowulf.</li></ol>

<h2>Gostak VI</h2>
<p>This battle introduces &ldquo;¶&rdquo;, the product of the next two symbols, as well as demonstrating that symbols can compose. So this Gostak deals §‡¶✠♫ = <code>absdiff(name length, distance × color A1Z26)</code> damage. <span class="embed">Yoshisaur Munchakoopas</span> is 21 letters and Green (G=7), and so can be placed at distance 3 to stabilize.</p>
<p>Solution: Bring 1&times; <span class="embed">Yoshisaur Munchakoopas</span>. Then:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin"><li>Turn 1: Play <span class="embed">Yoshisaur Munchakoopas</span> R4C3.</li><li>Turn 2 to 14: Just attack with it repeatedly.</li></ol>

<p>As before, we can put something behind <span class="embed">Yoshisaur Munchakoopas</span> to go faster. If we bring 1&times; <span class="embed">Yoshisaur Munchakoopas</span>, two arbitrary 1-drops, 1 <span class="embed">Glass of Moo</span> or <span class="embed">Glass of Moocha</span>, and 1 <span class="embed">Thesaurus</span>, then we can win as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin"><li>Turn 1: Play <span class="embed">Yoshisaur Munchakoopas</span> R4C3 and a 1-drop in front of another Camp.</li><li>Turn 2: Create with Yoshisaur Munchakoopas, then play Glass in R5C3 and another 1-drop in front of a Camp.</li><li>Turn 3: Create with Yoshisaur Munchakoopas, Special with the Glass, and play <span class="embed">Thesaurus</span> in R5C3.</li><li>Turn 4 to 9: Attack with <span class="embed">Thesaurus</span>.</li></ol>

<h2>Gostak VII</h2>
<p>The final battle: Each turn, this Gostak does §✠¶♠‡ damage, then ¶∮§♠‡ damage.</p>
<p>The new symbol, &ldquo;∮&rdquo;, is turn count, though it&rsquo;s not necessary to determine its meaning. All we need to know (or guess) is that it can&rsquo;t be 0, so to stabilize, we need to make the other factor it gets multiplied with 0. That is, we want §✠¶♠‡ = 0
and §♠‡ = 0, which means ♠ = ‡ and ✠ = ♠&times;‡ is a square. We can place <span class="embed">re</span> at distance 4 and buff it with <span class="embed">o</span> to 2 Health
to stabilize.</p>
<p>Solution: Bring 2&times; <span class="embed">re</span> and 1&times; <span class="embed">o</span>. Play re at R5C3 and R4C4, then play o at R5C4. (The <span class="embed">o</span> must be played last.) Then just repeatedly attack with them.</p>
<p>We can also Create enough Food with these Creatures to bring a <span class="embed">Rude Cow</span>. Bring 1&times; <span class="embed">o</span>, 2&times; <span class="embed">re</span>, 1&times; <span class="embed">Rude Cow</span>, then:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin"><li>Turn 1: Play re on R4C4, re on R5C3, o on R5C4.</li><li>Turn 2: Create with all Creatures and play <span class="embed">Rude Cow</span> on R6C4.</li><li>Turn 3 and onwards: Attack with <span class="embed">Rude Cow</span>.</li></ol>
