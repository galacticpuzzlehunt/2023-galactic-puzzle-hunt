<p>In the deepest reaches of the cave, boars have built a ‚Äúsmelloscope‚Äù, ARECIBOAR, to search for signals of extra-spelunkian life. We play as a boar who provides narration about the mysterious signals detected by ARECIBOAR. As we traverse right-to-left, we can ‚Äúsmell‚Äù the recordings of four signals, each represented by several moving glyphs. Three signals are shown alongside
their proposed meanings, which also relate to smells in some way. The left-most signal is undeciphered, so that‚Äôs what we need to figure out.</p>
<p>When overlaying the two animated states of most glyphs, they make the shape of English letters. There is an additional symbol, present in each signal, that looks like a leaf (and unlike other glyphs, shares pixels across the two sprites). Each leaf symbol can be substituted with the name of an herb (smelly!) to translate the signal into a pun matching the proposed meaning.</p>
<p>The signals, in right-to-left order, are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Signal</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
<th>Deciphered symbols</th>
<th>Fully translated word</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img class="img-hidden" src="areciboar/1.gif" alt="Moving glyphs representing üåøUSION"/></td>
<td>a belief in an untrue and aromatic reality</td>
<td>üåøUSION</td>
<td>DILLUSION</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img class="img-hidden" src="areciboar/2.gif" alt="Moving glyphs representing üåøLINE"/></td>
<td>the continuity of pungent moments in history</td>
<td>üåøLINE</td>
<td>THYMELINE</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img class="img-hidden" src="areciboar/3.gif" alt="Moving glyphs representing IMPLEüåø"/></td>
<td>to enact out a fragrant decision</td>
<td>IMPLEüåø</td>
<td>IMPLEMINT</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img class="img-hidden" src="areciboar/4.gif" alt="Moving glyphs representing MESüåø"/></td>
<td>[what could this be?]</td>
<td>MESüåø</td>
<td>MESSAGE</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As the game suggests, the left-most signal, <span class="spoiler">MESSAGE</span>, is our answer.</p>

    <p>The story of ARECIBOAR actually takes place in reverse order. Play ARECIBOAR in the forwards direction:</p>

<p>The full message received, in chronological order, reads: ‚ÄúMESSAGE: IMPLEMINT THYMELINE DILLUSION.‚Äù What does it mean? Who could it be from? I‚Äôll leave you and the boars to ponder that.</p>
<p>This is a sister game to <a href="https://2022.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/solution/your-puzzle#frogorf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FROGORF</a> from GPH 2022. As I wrote in the Author‚Äôs Notes of the FROGORF solution, (spoilers for the 2008 video game Braid) <span class="spoiler">the mechanic of time matching your spatial position appears in Braid World 4: Time and Place. ARECIBOAR‚Äôs story in reverse appears in the final world in Braid, World 1.</span></p>
<p>Facetious lore justification: the reason the spelling/pronunciation gimmick is inconsistent is because they are actually smells, not sounds/sights.</p>
<p>The ‚Äúsmell recordings‚Äù are inspired by the Nomai tablets in Outer Wilds. </p>
<p>ARECIBOAR is named after 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_Telescope" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arecibo</a>,
a radio telescope for astronomy research that is no longer standing. It was most famous for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, in particular for broadcasting the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arecibo message</a>
about humanity into space. Read the short story,
<a href="https://electricliterature.com/the-great-silence-by-ted-chiang/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Great Silence</a>
by Ted Chiang, shared by my teammate A.</p>
<p>Art for the ARECIBOAR smelloscope was made with a combination of the üì°üêΩ emojis and
<a href="https://potch.me/demos/playdither/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayDither</a>.</p>
<p>A week before hunt, I wanted to add ethereal music, with a subtle Rock Lobster bassline in the style of
<a href="https://youtu.be/L1igglghRW8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BOTW‚Äôs Temple of Time</a>. I cut this due to my lack of musical creativity and also since it would diminish the impact of the Kero fight surprise.</p>
<p>The letter glyphs were originally going to be cryptograms ‚Äì the puzzle is designed to be solvable this way with enough shared letters, teaching the glyphs for M, E, S in the later signals.</p>
<p>Thanks to S for additional sprite art and help during writing.</p>

Author‚Äôs Soapbox
</h2>
    <p>FROGORF and ARECIBOAR are a tale of two game engines: 
PuzzleScript and bitsy. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PuzzleScript</a>,
created by 
<a href="https://www.increpare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increpare</a>,
is a rules-based tool for making mechanics-driven puzzle games, like the classic block-pushing 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sokoban</a>.
Sokoban-like puzzles have appeared in hunts as early as 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180325232412/https://researchers.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~mums/puzzlehunt/2013/puzzles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2013 MUMS</a>‚Äô 
Sokobus (possibly lost to time), which predates the creation of PuzzleScript by a few months. Fun fact, PuzzleScript was influenced by Tom 7‚Äôs game, 
<a href="http://radar.spacebar.org/f/a/weblog/comment/1/1081" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">T in Y World</a>
(requires Flash player, another thing lost to time).</p>
<p>Anyways, many puzzlers have seen PuzzleScript games before, like the aforementioned FROGORF, and our 2017 hunt‚Äôs 
<a href="https://2017.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/4/5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen‚Äôs Speed Run</a>. 
The library of PuzzleScript games is vast and diverse, here is a small sample:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://parachor.itch.io/courtyard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Courtyard</a>
by Parachor, a beautifully classic block-pusher ‚Äì it originally appeared in the
<a href="https://www.puzzles.wiki/wiki/Ultraviolet_Puzzle_Challenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultraviolet Puzzle Challenge</a>,
still one of the most innovative puzzlehunts today</li>
<li><a href="https://souvey.itch.io/spawning-ground" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spawning Ground</a>

<li>Okay this is not PuzzleScript but I am so hype for 
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1233070/Isles_of_Sea_and_Sky/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isles of Sea and Sky</a>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.bitsy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bitsy</a>,
created by
<a href="https://www.adamledoux.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adam le doux</a>,
is a tool for making narrative-driven games. I imagine this puzzle, for many of you, is your first experience with it; unlike bitsy, there‚Äôs a much larger overlap between the PuzzleScript community and the puzzlehunt community. Play the third bitsy game made by its creator:

<p>The first time I played a bitsy game (unfortunately I forget which), I was struck by the simplicity of the gameplay paired with the way it captured my attention and evoked cathartic feelings. </p>
<p>There‚Äôs a great 
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/22929485/bitsy-tiny-video-game-engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a>
covering the origin of bitsy. Here are some bitsy games to try:</p>

</ul>
<p>bitsy, conceptually, is a polar opposite to PuzzleScript. PuzzleScript is mechanics-driven to its core, capable of demaking complex turn based puzzle games like 
<a href="https://competor.itch.io/patricks-parabox-puzzlescript-demake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patrick‚Äôs Parabox</a>
and 
<a href="https://galactical.itch.io/baba-is-you-puzzlescript-demake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baba Is You</a>.
bitsy has almost no interactive mechanics besides movement and dialogue, while games made in PuzzleScript are rarely narrative-driven. </p>
<p>And yet: games made in both engines use minimalist pixel art, and the character movement snaps along the grid. Perhaps that‚Äôs why I was so surprised to discover bitsy ‚Äì camouflaged by my familiarity of PuzzleScript, I found bitsy games surprisingly emotionally resonant; an unfamiliar closeness cloaked in familiar farness. </p>
<p>The more I explored, the more I saw that the social circles that bitsy grew around, on itch.io, discord, and webrings, seemed wholly similar to the hand-grown community of PuzzleScript. In fact, I realize now that the ‚Äúshow don‚Äôt tell‚Äù storytelling of bitsy struck me quite like increpare‚Äôs own 
<a href="https://www.increpare.com/game/heaven-on-earth.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">heaven on earth</a>.</p>
<p>The two engines really are more similar than they are different. Both engines are designed to be an accessible tool for making small games. Unlike generalist tools like 
<a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PICO-8</a>,
you‚Äôre heavily constrained by the engines‚Äô limitations. Both are open source and have a niche community of talented creators, a wellspring of advanced modifications
(<a href="https://pedros.works/game-tools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PuzzleScript tools</a>;
<a href="https://github.com/seleb/bitsy-hacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitsy mods</a>),
and a culture of sharing and remixing. Discussions/support are difficult to find on the internet, but there are great community resources (the
<a href="https://thinkypuzzlegames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thinky-puzzle-games discord</a>
for PuzzleScript, and 
<a href="https://discord.com/invite/9rAjhtr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bitscord</a>
for bitsy before moving to the
<a href="https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy/community" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bitsy forums</a>). And check this out:

<p>On one summer day, S and I made <a href="https://www.humfuzz.com/games/canadian-simulator/
" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">canadian simulator</a>, a bitsy game. I loved how fun it was to share a personal experience that others could relate to, and how easy it was to use bitsy. I decided to write a puzzle for this hunt in bitsy and at the same time create more boar lore for my favourite faction.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve long thought about this interplay between gameplay and narrative. My favourite games ‚Äì Outer Wilds, The Witness, Metroid Fusion, Return of the Obra Dinn ‚Äì embody a human experience in an inhuman world. There are many games that don't bridge this gap well (many would argue that The Witness doesn‚Äôt). Why do we often see such a wide disconnect between mechanics versus story? Look no further than puzzlehunts ‚Äì puzzlers are the most allergic to story of all gamers. In fact, answer driven hunt puzzles deliberately train puzzlers to ignore irrelevant data, to despise red herrings.
<a href="https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/ub/sums/puzzlehunt/2016/archives" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Œ£UMS Puzzle Hunts</a>
used to package every puzzle with a story page, but every puzzler would skip to the puzzle content, before bemoaning having to dig through every story for metapuzzle data.</p>
<p>In writing this puzzle, I wanted to situate the artificiality of ‚Äúextracting an answer from data‚Äù in the world we created. Boars are 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truffle_hog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">excellent sniffers</a>,
after all ‚Äì surely their curious, industrial, and enterprising scientists would create ARECIBOAR for a whiff of the outside world. I could have simply presented the data in the table above and asked you to find the missing answer: maybe that would have been a ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù puzzle? Or maybe I could have focused on finding a more elegant puzzle mechanic instead of something fairly trite. In reality, it‚Äôs not a zero-sum game. Let‚Äôs all try to integrate both clever mechanics and immersive storytelling in our puzzles and puzzlehunts, and share our personal experiences with others.</p>
